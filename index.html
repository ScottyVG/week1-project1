It has since been adopted by all other major browsers, and is the basis for modern web applications.<br>      The interactivity runs smoother on a web page as page reloads are not needed for every action since the JavaScript is downloaded to the user's computer and then processed within the browser.<br>      Apps like Gmail, Google Maps, and Facebook are possible because of JS.<br>      When JavaScript was first introduced, Java was being heavily marketed and adopted, and JavaScript sought to ride on the success. Now we are stuck with the name. </p><br></br>    <p>The goal for this course is to establish a solid foundation of:      <ul>        <li>how the language is structured</li>        <li>learn how to use JavaScript to create an interactive DOM</li>        <li>integrate external sites and data</li>        <li>successfully deploy an application (or two).</li>      </ul></p>  <h2>Outputting JavaScript</h2>    <p>JavaScript can "display" content in different ways:      <ul>        <li>Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().</li>        <li>Writing into the HTML output using document.write().</li>        <li>Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.</li>        <li>Writing into the browser console, using console.log().</li>      </ul></p><br></br>    <p><strong>window.alert()</strong><br>An alert box pops up over the browser and can display information. The user will have to click "OK" to close the alert box and this is most often used to make sure the user sees the message.</p>    <div class="code"><p>alert("I am an alert box!");</p></div>    <p><strong>document.write()</strong><br>This method is useful for testing purposes and adding JS directly into an HTML page.</p>    <div class="code"><p>document.write("I'm text added directly to the web page using JS.");</p></div>    <p>Be careful when using document.write() as when it is called after an HTML document is fully loaded and will <stong>delete all existing HTML.</stong></p>    <p><strong>innerHTML</strong><br>JavaScript can be added to the web page by targeting an ID.</p>    <div class="code"><p>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 'JS content can be added to a unique ID';</p></div>  <br></br><p>Make sure you check the console for your code.</p><h3>Google Chrome</h3><ul>    <li>Mac: <strong>Command + Option + J</strong></li>    <li>Win: <strong>Control + Shift + J</strong> </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
